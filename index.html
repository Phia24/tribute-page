Through every role he played, he brought dignity, depth, and inspiration to millions around the world. Even in silence about his own struggles, he continued to create work that uplifted others. His legacy lives on not only in iconic characters like King T’Challa, but in the hearts of all who saw hope and courage in him. Thank you, Chadwick, for showing us what true heroism looks like—on and off the screen. Wakanda Forever. 🖤✨</p><br>
